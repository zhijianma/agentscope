"""ReMe middleware demo (embedded reme-ai, AgentScope-driven).

Drives two independent agent **sessions** that share one ReMe
workspace, so ReMe's cross-session memory effect is visible: session 1
states a durable preference, the middleware writes it back
automatically, and a *fresh* session-2 agent — with an empty chat
context — recalls it through ReMe.

Each turn streams events from ``agent.reply_stream`` and prints the
ones that matter:

- ``[reme → context (static)]`` — the memory note the middleware
  appended to ``state.context``. Retrieval runs in the background and the
  note is injected on a reasoning step once the search finishes, so the
  demo surfaces it the moment it appears (best-effort: a single-shot reply
  may finish before it lands)
- ``[tool call (agent)]`` — each ``memory_search`` invocation the
  agent makes on its own (there is no add tool — writing is automatic)
- ``[assistant]`` — the assistant's reply, concatenated from the
  ``TextBlockDeltaEvent`` stream
- ``[context → reme (auto)]`` — what ReMe persisted after the turn,
  surfaced by searching the workspace

The mode tag (``static`` / ``agent``) on each line tells you which
control path produced it.

Unlike mem0, ReMe is **embedded in-process** (no separate service to
run) and records memory by **listening to the conversation** — after
every reply the new exchange is written back via ReMe's ``auto_memory``
job, in *all* modes. ``mode`` only controls *retrieval*. The agent
never writes memory itself.

ReMe drives its LLM-backed ``auto_memory`` write-back and its vector
search through AgentScope models injected here — a DashScope chat model
and embedding model — so the only credential needed is a DashScope key.

Starts each run from a clean workspace so the demo is reproducible.

    pip install "agentscope[reme]"
    export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-...
